To run dimension independent classifiers presented in the paper **Interpreting decision-making process for multivariate time series classification**, use the .ipynb file at **experiments/notebooks/dimension_independent_classifiers.ipynb**

To run the explainability experiments presented in the paper **Interpreting decision-making process for multivariate time series classification**, use the .ipynb file at **experiments/notebooks/mts_explain.ipynb**

The first step to run the experiments is to install **environment.yml** file with the command **conda env create -f environment.yml**
